                            <h3>The Power of Insight to Progress and Deliver DoingOurBit</h3>
                            <p>DoingOurBit was created as a result of passion, desire, collaboration, and insight. Insight is crucial to a concept landing well with its target audience. And it’s vital to continue gaining insight as things progress, to ensure things remain relevant and add value.</p>
                            <p>Insight can be gleaned from all manner of places, including user and non-user insight, consumer panels, and feedback from friends and colleagues. We draw on a range of feedback from DoingOurBit users and contributors to the platform. Their voices and views help us to shape the offer, attract partners, and gain recognition from operators within the wider leisure industry.</p>
                            <p>Here are a few examples of how this works in practice to keep us on our toes and aligned with the wider wellness agenda:</p>

                            <h4>Supporting Summer Sport Legacy</h4>
                            <p>Following a busy summer of sport, new research from the Vitality American Express® Credit Card shows that on average, Brits are planning to spend £795 to keep motivated on their health and fitness journeys for the rest of 2024. This includes monthly spending on gym memberships, sportswear, and fitness apps.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>DoingOurBit is free to NHS and Social Care workers, removing cost barriers to being active.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>What’s the Real Value of a ‘Membership’?</h4>
                            <p>Recent polling by ukactive reveals that being a member of a fitness facility positively impacts perceptions of physical activity’s value. For instance, 45% of members feel physical activity is crucial for health, compared to 30% of non-members.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>DoingOurBit not only offers an online community but also links to fitness facilities, allowing NHS and Social Care colleagues to participate in classes nationwide.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Preferred Ways to Be More Active</h4>
                            <p>Regular insight collected from leisure centers in the South East shows high interest in swimming, strength training, cardio, and group classes.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>DoingOurBit supports NHS and Social Care workers by offering online workouts and is expanding to include swimming sessions and group classes.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Breaking Down Barriers</h3>
                            <p>By reducing the barriers of cost, location, and time with an offering that can be accessed at home or in a facility, DoingOurBit takes a 360-degree approach to wellness. With additional resources on nutrition and financial challenges, the platform ensures holistic support for its users.</p>
                            <p>Active Insight is proud to contribute and will continue to bring valuable insight to keep the project fresh and rewarding for all.</p>
